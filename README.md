# PhilipsTVRemoteChrome

A little chrome extension that puts the remote for your Philips Smart TV under a button in your browser.

Modeled after and graphics slightly stolen from Philips MyRemote from android.

Works by performing a portscan on your LAN to find TV's listening to the [JointSpace](http://jointspace.sourceforge.net/) API on port 1925
once you select your TV, you can send commands to it by just clicking the buttons like you're used to in the Philips MyRemote for Android App.

Available in the Chrome WebStore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tv-remote-for-philips-sma/gpjdnkhbioemglbhdaaikcnkdcnpgiph)
